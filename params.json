It is being developed at LETS (Laboratório de Ecologia Teórica e Síntese) in UFG (Universidade Federal de Goiás, Brazil) as part of a larger project looking to integrate recent advances in macroecological data handling and processing. Its purpose is to make some of our commonly used but unavailable R functions available to the larger public. The package provides useful R functions for researchers in ecology and evolution.\r\n\r\nThe letsR package is in continuous development and suggestions are more than welcome!\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy it and find it useful.\r\n\r\n====\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nInstall `letsR` from CRAN\r\n\r\n```coffee\r\ninstall.packages(\"letsR\")\r\nlibrary(\"letsR\")\r\n```\r\nInstall `letsR` developers version from github\r\n\r\n\r\n```coffee\r\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"macroecology/letsR\")\r\nlibrary(letsR)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOBS.: To download the developers version you will need to have the git software installed (http://git-scm.com/).\r\nIf you are a windows user you will also need to download the Rtools (http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Key functions\r\n\r\nThe `letsR` package includes many different functions. Below we highlight some them:\r\n\r\n- `lets.presab`: Builts a presence-absence matrix (sites x species) based on species’ range maps from shapefiles.\r\n- `lets.presab.birds`: Builts a presence-absence matrix (sites x species) based on species’ range maps from shapefiles (specially designed for the BirdLife International database).\r\n- `lets.shFilter`: Filter species’ shapefiles by origin, presence and seasonal type (following IUCN categorization of species’ distributional ranges).\r\n- `lets.addvar`: Add variables in raster format to a presence-absence matrix.\r\n- `lets.addpoly`: Add variables in polygon format to a presence-absence matrix.\r\n- `lets.iucn`: Get species’ information from the IUCN website (different from `taxize` version).\r\n- `lets.iucn.ha`: Get species’ habitat information from the IUCN website.\r\n- `lets.iucn.his`: Get information on the history of species’ conservation status from the IUCN website.\r\n\r\nTake a look at the functions' help files for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
